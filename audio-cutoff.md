## Fix:
### Step 1:
Install realtime-setup:
```sudo dnf in realtime-setup```

Add your user into realtime group with:
```sudo usermod -aG realtime <user>```

### Step 2:
Copy /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf to /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf

And then uncomment & edit these properties: 
```
    loop.rt-prio = -1
    default.clock.quantum       = 2048 #1024
    default.clock.min-quantum   = 1024 #32
    default.clock.max-quantum   = 4096 #2048
```
Finally, reboot your system to apply changes.
